  <p>Sorry we tricked you! We are working together to investigate how suceptable people can be to phishing attacks.
    This is a joit project at as a part of our univeristy studies at UCCS. We dont want ANY personal information from you. 
    Phishing is when someone poses as someone or someting else to try to take sensitive informatin from you.
    This is a growing threat all around the word and has played a part in some of the worlds worst cyber insidents.
    Since you clicked the link that means you thought that you thought you where going to see someting else which would be the first step in the phishing process.
    All we wanted to find out as university students is if people would click the link.
    When you clicked the link we where able to see that we tricked someone and are able to discuss this in/with our class.
    Please look below to take a survey we have set up. This information would be extreamly helpful in our university studies.
    You can also email us at phishingprojectuccs@gmail.com for more information.
    Thank you for your help!</p>
